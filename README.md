# AI plays Assetto Corsa using imitation learning and reinforcement learning

## Summary

This project aims to use a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning in order to play Assetto Corsa. 

Assetto Corsa is a highly acclaimed car racing simulator, with a very robust physics engine, and a very vivid community supporting it. It contains a variety of modes, but this project deals with improving the lap time, and using imitation learning and reinforcement learning for the agent to develop policies so that it can optimize the driving style, and achieve a better lap time than the expert. 

The worflow of this project is as follows:- 

1. Collect training data of expert driving the car. 
2. Train the agent using a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to optimize the lap time. 
3. Run the agent with the trained agent.
